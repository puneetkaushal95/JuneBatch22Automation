What is OR or Object Repository?
In automation in OR file we store locators and their values. It is a way to have a central repository for all your objects.

Advantages:
All our objects are stored at a single place. Easier to maintain. Removes duplicity.

Disadvantages:
Over a period of time, it may grow large, and might have performance issues.
When working in collaboration, one change might affect the whole life.

How to implement?
Step1: locate OR.properties.
Step2: Read the value by calling getProperty()

Page Object Model(POM)
* It is the style of writing actions into java classes and its popular in Automation Testing. It says for every webpage that you are testing, there should be
a java class with the same name. And you will record all the elements, actions of that page into the java class, and you
will return the object of that page.

1. Record all elements - username field, password, field, submit
2. Record all actions - type into username, password, click - type into username, password, click on submit
3. Always return the object of that page from the action methods
